# Insta-unrushed: weekly sketchbook tour

There are two versions of this week's reel:

1. **3D flip-book** (`make_flipbook.py` → `output/sketchbook_flipbook.mp4`, 59 s, 30 fps): an open sketchbook floats in a snowy night scene and flips through the pages, with big white hand-lettered captions. To float the book over your own footage instead of the drawn scene, run `python3 make_flipbook.py --bg my_clip.mp4`.
2. **Papercut stop-motion** (`make_video.py` → `output/sketchbook_tour.mp4`), described below.

## Cinematic edit

`output/cinematic.mp4` (1920×1080, 8 s, 24 fps) is a Hollywood-style edit of a 5 s phone clip of sunlight through window bars:

- 1.6× optical-flow slow motion and a slow push-in
- golden teal/orange grade with a vignette and film grain
- 2.39:1 letterbox bars and a fade from and to black
- sound design: a sub-bass boom on the open and a swelling low drone over the clip's own slowed-down, reverbed room tone

To re-render it, or to apply the same look to another clip, run `./make_cinematic.sh input.mp4 output/cinematic.mp4` (needs ffmpeg).

## Papercut version

A papercut stop-motion reel (1080×1920, 56 s) made from this week's sketchbook pages. It has burned-in captions and no voice-over.

- `output/sketchbook_tour.mp4`: the finished reel. It has a silent audio track, so you can add music in Instagram.
- `output/cover.jpg`: cover frame for the reel.
- `output/instagram_caption.txt`: post caption with hashtags.
- `artworks/`: the source paintings.
- `make_video.py`: the renderer.

## Re-rendering

```
python3 make_video.py                 # full render (needs ffmpeg, Pillow, numpy)
python3 make_video.py --preview 3 20  # stills at the given seconds -> output/preview/
```

The story, captions, colours and timings are all in `build()` in `make_video.py`.
