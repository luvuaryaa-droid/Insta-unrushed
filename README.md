# Insta-unrushed: weekly sketchbook tour

There are two versions of this week's reel:

1. **3D flip-book** (`make_flipbook.py` → `output/sketchbook_flipbook.mp4`, 59 s, 30 fps): an open sketchbook floats in a snowy night scene and flips through the pages, with big white hand-lettered captions. To float the book over your own footage instead of the drawn scene, run `python3 make_flipbook.py --bg my_clip.mp4`.
2. **Papercut stop-motion** (`make_video.py` → `output/sketchbook_tour.mp4`), described below.

## Books that inspired me

A separate papercut reel (`make_books.py` → `output/books_reel.mp4`, 1080×1920, 45.5 s). It has one scene per book, each with a paper cover and a note on what the book gave me, and it ends on a stack of all seven spines. The covers are hand-made stand-ins, not the real jackets. The cover frame is in `output/books_cover.jpg` and the post caption is in `output/books_caption.txt`. To change a title, colour or note, edit `BOOKS` in `make_books.py`, then run `python3 make_books.py`. Use `--preview` to render stills only.

## Papercut version

A papercut stop-motion reel (1080×1920, 56 s) made from this week's sketchbook pages. It has burned-in captions and no voice-over.

- `output/sketchbook_tour.mp4`: the finished reel. It has a silent audio track, so you can add music in Instagram.
- `output/cover.jpg`: cover frame for the reel.
- `output/instagram_caption.txt`: post caption with hashtags.
- `artworks/`: the source paintings.
- `make_video.py`: the renderer.

## Re-rendering

```
python3 make_video.py                 # full render (needs ffmpeg, Pillow, numpy)
python3 make_video.py --preview 3 20  # stills at the given seconds -> output/preview/
```

The story, captions, colours and timings are all in `build()` in `make_video.py`.
